Semi-Supervised semantic segmentation techniques focus on the Consistency Regulation, Teacher-Student-based framework,  Pseudo-Labeling, and self-training. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervision share many similarities regarding training dataset characteristics, commonly used techniques and loss functions. Starting from this point, we hypothesize that the UDA domain encompasses the semi-supervised domain. We explore the integration of cross-domain methods and propose UDA-Based SSL concept, providing new perspectives and opportunities for existing UDA techniques, enhancing performance, and expanding the range of applications. Recent trends in semi-supervised papers reveal that Consistency Regulation and the Teacher-Student model framework are foundational to the latest methods. We propose the new architecture "Student Consistency Framework" to further strengthen the Teacher-Student model framework
using consistency regularization. This framework uses the teacher model to provide more accurate pseudo labels to the student model while implementing Consistency Regulation within the student model to enhance its robustness. Additionally, the robustness of the teacher model, updated through EMA, will also improve. Furthermore, addressing the current situation of relatively uniform feature perturbation, we propose a method for feature perturbation called Feature Masking. This method masks features processed by the Encoder on a patch-by-patch basis, forcing the model to infer the information of the masked parts from the unmasked parts, thereby strengthening the model's ability to understand the relationships between features.

Combining the concepts above, the contributions of this thesis are as follows:

* __UDA-Based SSL concept__: This thesis proposes a SSL method based on UDA, integrating concepts from both fields to provide new directions for existing technologies, thereby enhancing performance and expanding application scopes.

* __Student Consistency Framework__: This thesis introduces a method to enhance the student model framework through Consistency Regulation, improving the robustness of both the student and teacher models, thus increasing overall accuracy.

* __Feature Masking Method__: This thesis proposes a method of masking features at the patch level, enabling the model to predict complete content from incomplete features, thereby strengthening the model's ability to relate features.

* __Superior Experimental Performance__: Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Cityscapes dataset with labeling ratios of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, the Classic Pascal VOC dataset with labeling ratios of Full, 1/2, and 1/4, and the Blended Pascal VOC dataset with labeling ratios of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8. Additionally, in ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of each proposed method.
